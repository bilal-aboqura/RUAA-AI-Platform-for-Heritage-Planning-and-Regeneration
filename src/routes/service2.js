The generated output must match the reference building precisely in: overall massing and footprint shape, number of floors and floor heights, wall thickness and material, window count and placement pattern, door positions and sizes, roof type and parapet design, facade proportions, color palette, and ornamental details. Do NOT invent a new building. Do NOT change the building proportions. Do NOT add or remove floors. Do NOT alter the fundamental shape. The output must look like a photograph of the SAME building from a different angle, not a different building in a similar style.

The building is being rehabilitated for contemporary use as [PROPOSED_USE] while preserving its original identity.
The selected architectural style is [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE].
The requested output view is [REQUESTED_VIEW].
You must generate only the requested view type and not any other view.

Identity preservation rules (MANDATORY):
- The building proportions (width-to-height ratio) must match the reference images exactly.
- The number of floors must be identical to the reference.
- The facade rhythm (spacing and count of openings) must be consistent with the reference.
- The wall materials, colors, and textures must match the reference.
- The roof shape, parapet style, and upper edge treatment must match the reference.
- Decorative elements must appear in the same density and style as the reference.
- The building scale relative to human figures must be consistent across all views.

View control rules:
- FRONT: true front facade with main entrance and principal identity.
- REAR: true back facade, simpler composition, secondary openings, no main entrance. NOT another front facade.
- LEFT SIDE: true left-side elevation with side massing, side openings, and wall depth. NOT another front facade.
- RIGHT SIDE: true right-side elevation with side massing, side openings, and wall depth. NOT another front facade.
- AERIAL: oblique bird-eye view showing massing, roofscape, courtyard, and spatial layout from above.
- INTERIOR: interior view such as courtyard, hall, or heritage space. NOT a facade or aerial.
- NIGHT: night view with warm architectural lighting. Same building, same proportions, just at night.
- FLOOR PLAN: true 2D top-down floor plan only. Flat, from above, walls, rooms, doors, circulation. NOT a 3D render.

Strict constraints:
- Do NOT generate a different building than the one in the reference images.
- Do NOT alter the building massing, proportions, or scale.
- Do NOT confuse views. Each view must be unambiguously identifiable.
- Do NOT generate multiple view types in one image.
- Preserve heritage character. Avoid fantasy, unrelated modern forms, excessive glass, or exaggerated ornamentation.

Atmosphere: Make the scene lively with a few people, soft greenery, and calm activity. Keep architecture as the main focus. Do not overcrowd.

Preserve the original facade identity, symmetry where appropriate, decorative elements, material character, and style-specific details. Make the facade elegant, realistic, and suitable for adaptive reuse as [PROPOSED_USE]. Make the scene lively and inhabited with subtle human activity. Include a few visitors near the entrance, soft landscape elements, potted plants, palms or style-appropriate planting, and refined outdoor details. Add movement and life, but keep the composition uncluttered and architecturally readable. This must be a true front facade architectural visualization, not an aerial view, not an interior, and not a side elevation.",
  rear: "Generate the REAR facade of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style. This must be a true back-side architectural view, not a front facade. Make the composition simpler and less ceremonial than the front elevation. Avoid a grand main entrance, avoid overly formal symmetry, and show realistic secondary rear treatment with back openings, service-side architectural details, and reduced ornamentation while still preserving the selected architectural style. Make the scene lively and inhabited with subtle human presence, garden elements, potted plants, palms or context-appropriate greenery, and realistic outdoor life. Add a few people naturally using the rear space, but keep the image calm and elegant. The rear facade should still feel active and visually appealing without looking like the main public entrance. Do not generate another front facade. The requested output must clearly represent the back side of the building.",
  right: "Generate the RIGHT SIDE elevation of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style. This must be a true right-side architectural facade, not a front-facing view. Show the building from the right side with believable side-wall composition, side openings, depth, massing, and secondary facade details that remain consistent with the selected architectural language. Make the scene lively and inhabited. Include a few people walking or standing naturally, soft greenery, potted plants, palm trees or context-appropriate landscape elements, and refined outdoor details. Add realistic signs of use and daily life while keeping the right-side facade clearly visible and readable. Do not generate another front facade. The requested output must clearly represent the right side of the building.",
  left: "Generate the LEFT SIDE elevation of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style. This must be a true left-side architectural facade, not a front-facing view. Show the side massing, side windows, realistic wall depth, and coherent secondary architectural details that match the selected heritage design language. Make the scene lively, inhabited, and visually rich in a subtle way. Include a few people, potted plants, palm trees or context-appropriate vegetation, and soft outdoor environmental details. The human presence should feel natural and calm, and the greenery should support the scene without overpowering the architecture. Do not generate another front facade. The requested output must clearly represent the left side of the building.",
  aerial: "Generate an AERIAL architectural view of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style from an oblique bird's-eye perspective. Show the overall building massing, roofscape, courtyard organization, upper-level details, and spatial layout clearly. Preserve the style-specific character, proportions, materials, and decorative language. Make the image lively and inhabited. Add subtle human presence in courtyards or surrounding areas, soft landscape features, palms or style-appropriate vegetation, potted plants, and realistic environmental context. The scene should feel alive and believable while keeping the architecture as the main visual focus. This must be a true aerial architectural visualization, not a front facade and not an interior view.",
  interior: "Generate a realistic INTERIOR architectural view of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style, such as a courtyard, hall, or ceremonial interior space. Preserve arches, carved details, ceilings, traditional proportions, ornamental surfaces, and authentic material character according to the selected architectural style. Make the interior feel lively and inhabited. Include a few people interacting naturally in the space, along with indoor plants, courtyard greenery, soft decorative elements, and subtle signs of use. The atmosphere should feel warm, elegant, active, and believable without becoming crowded. This must be a true interior architectural visualization, not a floor plan, not a facade, and not an aerial view.",
  night: "Generate a NIGHT architectural view of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style with warm, elegant lighting that highlights the facade details, openings, ornamental character, and material textures. Preserve the architectural identity of the selected style while creating a refined and presentation-ready nighttime atmosphere. Make the scene lively and inhabited. Include a few people, subtle night-time activity, palm trees or style-appropriate planting, potted plants, and realistic outdoor context. The building should feel active and welcoming at night, with balanced lighting and visible human life, but without overcrowding the image. This must be a true night view with believable evening atmosphere and architectural lighting.",
  floorplan: "Generate a true 2D top-down architectural floor plan of a heritage building. The output must be a real floor plan viewed directly from above, not an interior perspective, not an aerial rendering, not a facade, and not a 3D scene. Clearly show walls, room layout, doors, circulation paths, courtyard organization, entrances, and spatial relationships. The plan should be readable, structured, and professionally composed like an architectural drawing. Reflect the selected architectural style in the spatial organization and plan logic. If the style is Najdi, use thick walls, courtyard-based layout, and restrained traditional organization. If the style is Hejazi, reflect urban heritage house planning, inner courtyard logic, and elegant room distribution. If the style is Aseeri, reflect regional spatial character and mountain-context planning where appropriate. If the style is Contemporary with heritage identity, preserve traditional references while introducing refined contemporary planning logic. Make the floor plan visually rich and lively in a presentation-friendly way without turning it into a perspective scene. Add subtle architectural presentation elements such as labeled spaces, furniture blocks, courtyard planting, trees or planters in open areas, water features if appropriate, and small human scale indicators from top view only. Keep these details clean, minimal, and organized so the drawing remains clear and readable. Use a clean top-down architectural representation with refined linework, balanced composition, realistic heritage planning logic, and strong graphic clarity. Do not generate perspective depth, shadows of a 3D render, eye-level interior views, exterior facades, or oblique aerial views. The final result must look like a true architectural floor plan from above.",
  street: "Generate a human-scale STREET PERSPECTIVE of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style from pedestrian eye level. Show the arrival experience, facade depth, entrance approach, and surrounding urban context clearly while preserving the original architectural identity. Make the scene lively and inhabited with subtle human activity, soft greenery, potted plants, and style-appropriate landscape details. The image should feel realistic, elegant, and presentation-ready while keeping the architecture as the main subject. This must be a true street-level architectural visualization, not an aerial view, not an interior, and not a facade-only elevation.",
  detail: "Generate a close-up FACADE DETAIL visualization of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style. Focus on craftsmanship, material texture, ornamental patterns, openings, screens, carvings, or decorative elements that define the building character. Preserve the original material authenticity and restoration quality while keeping the image realistic and presentation-ready. Add only subtle contextual life cues if visible, but keep the architectural detail as the clear focus. This must be a true architectural detail view, not a full facade, not an aerial view, and not an interior scene.",
  adaptive_reuse: "Generate a realistic ADAPTIVE REUSE INTERIOR view of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style for use as [PROPOSED_USE]. Show how the original shell, arches, materials, and heritage details are preserved while the new use is inserted in a balanced, elegant, and believable way. Make the interior feel active and inhabited with a few people, subtle furnishings, soft planting, and refined presentation quality. The result must feel architecturally coherent, respectful of the original structure, and clearly suitable for the proposed new use. This must be a true interior adaptive reuse visualization, not a facade, not an aerial view, and not a floor plan.",
  sectional: "Generate an architectural SECTIONAL PERSPECTIVE of the heritage building in [ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE] style. Show the building envelope, interior spatial hierarchy, floor-to-floor relationships, courtyard or hall organization, and adaptive reuse logic clearly. Preserve heritage character, material identity, and style-specific details while presenting the cut-through view in a refined architectural way. Keep the image presentation-ready, believable, and clearly readable as a sectional architectural visualization rather than a standard exterior render.",
